## Overview
This is a micro-blogging app, broadly made in the style of Bluesky. In addition to serving as practice for my skills with SQL, I've also used this project to develop my skill with Passport.js.

## Technologies
Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, EJS, Passport.js

## Challenges/To-dos
The greatest challenge came learning to query the DB for a specific user, and making queries with consideration to the current user. I had previously done this with MongoDB, so adapting my approach to PostgreSQL took some time. I also challenged myself to limit the number of views as much as possible and aim for a flattened, single-page experience.
I'd like to develop this further with user profile customization, profile pictures, , image sharing, and other social media features.
I'd also like to add some animations on showing forms and page loading. I played with it for a little while but ultimately decided to stay within a simple scope.

## How to use
When you first load the page, you can read any existing posts from other users. 
To add your own posts and see the usernames and timestamps on others, you must first sign up with a username, email, and password.
Once you've created your account, you may log in. Next, select your username in the page header, and enter the verification password.
Verification password: <Still a secret to be shared personally!>

Once you've entered the verification password, you will be able to create your own posts using the collapsable form.

If you select your username as a verified member, you can enter a special admin password, and gain the access to delete any post in addition to your own.
